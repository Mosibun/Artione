        A chess board consists of 64 squares, 8 rows by 8 columns, on which the chess pieces are placed.
        It is square in shape and uses two colors of squares, one is called light and another one is 
        called Dark Square, in a chequered pattern. During play, the board is oriented in such a way 
        that each player's near right corner square is a light square. The columns of chessboard are 
        known as files and the rows are known as ranks, and the lines of adjoining same colored squares
        (each running from one edge of the board to an adjacent edge) are known as diagonals. Each 
        square of the board is named using algebraic, descriptive or numeric chess notation; algebraic
        notation is the FIDE standard. In algebraic notation, using White's perspective, files are
        labeled a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h from left to right, and ranks are labeled 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 from bottom
        to top. Each square is identified by the file and rank which it occupies.
