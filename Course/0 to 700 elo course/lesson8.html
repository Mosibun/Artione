        Castling is a special move in chess. It consists of moving the king two squares toward a rook
        on the same rank and then moving the rook to the square that the king passed over in a move.
        There are two types of castle: short castle and long castle.
        <br><br>
        How to do short castle?
        <br><br>
        Look at this position.
        <div class="img-container">

        </div>
        <br><br>
        If you want to castle then the king will go to g1 and the rook will come to f1 square. For example_
        <br><br>
        <div class="img-container">
            <img src="img.code/Screenshot (708).png" class="img" alt="Chess board">
        </div>
        <br><br>
        Let's talk about long castle. Short castle and long castle is same in imporatance. Look
        at the position in below
        <br><br>
        <div class="img-container">
            <img src="img.code/Screenshot (709).png" class="img" alt="Chess board">
        </div>
        <br><br>
        Now if you want to castle then you have move your king in c1 and rook to d1 square.
        Like the example below
        <br><br>
        <div class="img-container">
            <img src="img.code/Screenshot (710).png" class="img" alt="Chess board">
        </div>
        <br><br>
        If you want to castle then he have to maintain some rules of castling.
        You have to ensure the things-
        <ul>
            <li>Is the king in a check or not,</li>
            <li>king has been moved once or not,</li>
            <li>rook which he wants to use to castle has been moved once or not,</li>
            <li>all squares in between king and rook is empty or not</li>
        </ul>
        Also you have to ensure that, the squares that king will use to go it must be free from check.
        If someone does short castle then their king and rook goes to kingside and if someone
        does long castle then their king and rook goes to queenside. Doing castling earlier is a
        golden rule of chess. By doing castling, someone can protect their king also activates
        their rook. 
        <br><br>
        But sometimes castling might be very dangerous if someone have been attacked
        by opponentâ€™s minor pieces and major pieces. After castling be careful about the 
        backrank checkmate. To avoid it you have push pawn of h file (if king side). Must 
        be careful about this, if it is middle game then if the pawn structure is not good 
        in castle side then it may be dangerous for king. Overall castling gives potential 
        power to win the game and also reduce the chances of losing. For castling must 
        ensure the rules and avoid castling if it is not good (that we have written in top).
        <br><br><br><br>
        Now it's time to solve some puzzle regarding to castle.
